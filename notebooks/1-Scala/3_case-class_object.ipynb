    "An `object` in Scala is a singleton, meaning it represents a single instance of a class. Objects are often used to hold utility methods or constants. Unlike Python's static methods, Scala's `object` can inherit from classes and traits. Because they are guaranteed to be single instances per program, they are a natural place to put caching mechanisms and other constructs that should only appear once."

    "2. **Immutability**: `case class` instances are immutable by default. `object` and `case object` are also effectively immutable as they can't be instantiated multiple times.\n",
    "3. **Utility**: `object` is often used for utility functions, `case class` for modeling data, and `case object` for singleton pattern matching.\n",
    "4. **Inheritance**: `object` can inherit from classes and traits, whereas `case class` and `case object` generally shouldn't (though they can).\n",
    "5. **Pattern Matching**: `case class` and `case object` are optimized for pattern matching, whereas `object` is not.\n",
    "6. **Methods**: All three can have methods, but `case class` often avoids them to remain a pure data structure."
