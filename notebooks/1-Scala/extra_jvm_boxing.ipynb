    "## What is Boxing?\n",
    "In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), **boxing** refers to the process of wrapping a primitive type (e.g., `int`, `float`) in its corresponding reference type (e.g., `Integer`, `Float`). The opposite process is called **unboxing**, where the reference type is unwrapped to get its primitive value. Scala, being a JVM language, inherits this behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specialization in Scala\n",
    "Scala provides a mechanism called **specialization** to avoid boxing overhead in certain cases. Specialization allows the JVM to use primitive values directly for specific type parameters. Essentially, bytecode is duplicated for each specialized type, trading jar size for significant performance improvements which would otherwise be lost as a consequence of working with generic functions that range over numeric types. This is achieved using the `@specialized` annotation. Let's see a quick demonstration of how specialization can be used."
