    "When defining a contract that multiple classes must adhere to, Scala provides two primary constructs: Traits and Abstract Classes. In Python, you might be familiar with abstract classes. Traits in Scala serve a similar but more flexible purpose."

    "## Differences between Traits and Abstract Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Constructor Parameters**: Abstract classes can have constructor parameters, traits cannot.\n",
    "2. **Multiple Inheritance**: A class can inherit multiple traits but only one abstract class.\n",
    "3. **Type of Inheritance**: Traits are mixed into classes using `extends` for the first trait and `with` for subsequent traits. Abstract classes use `extends`.\n",
    "4. **Instantiation**: Neither traits nor abstract classes can be instantiated.\n",
    "5. **Access Modifiers**: Abstract classes can have `protected` and `private` members, while traits cannot have `protected` members (but they can have `private` members).\n",
    "6. **Final Methods**: Both traits and abstract classes can contain final methods (methods that can't be overridden).\n",
    "7. **Linearization**: Traits support a feature called 'Linearization' which defines a clear hierarchy when multiple traits are mixed into a class.\n",
    "8. **Static Members**: Traits cannot have static members. In abstract classes, `static` members are simulated by putting them in companion objects."
