These can be created almost for free and stored in arrays by the tens of thousands for almost no memory overhead. This also means that they can be serialized by a distributed framework like Spark and shipped around for processing to appropriate nodes. Let's call `read` and use some pattern matching to destructure the optional return value so that we can render this sample OSGEO tiff. Types annotations are included for documentation purposes."
